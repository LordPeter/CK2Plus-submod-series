This is just a quick compatch, more alpha then beta!
It was tested, and seems to work fine - but there might be bugs.

Bugs:
If there are bugs, feel free to report them.

#Installation:

1)	Copy the entire contents of the folder titled "mod" into the directory with the same name.
	That's where your CK2+ mod files are located, too.

	(No more overwrite needed since version 0.0.2, now works automatically.)

2)	Check the new mod ("VIET+") in the launcher.

3)	[Optional] Enjoy :)
